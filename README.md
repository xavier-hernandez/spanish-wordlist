# spanish wordlist

I needed a spanish word list that was FREE and it was pretty hard to find. I finally found something created by user sbosio and can be found here https://github.com/sbosio/rla-es . They created a dictionary tool but I was able to retrieve the words only.

Currently the file is available via text and contains 76440 words.

Please drop a line if something appears to be wrong.
